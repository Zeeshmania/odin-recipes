    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        To make pizza, start by preparing the dough, combining flour, yeast, water, salt, and olive oil, kneading until smooth, then allowing it to rise until doubled in size. While the dough rises, prepare your pizza sauce by simmering crushed tomatoes with garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil until thickened and flavorful. Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally around 475째F (245째C), and place a pizza stone inside to heat up. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into equal portions, rolling each portion out into a thin, even circle on a floured surface. Transfer the rolled dough onto a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel lightly dusted with flour or cornmeal. Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add your desired toppings, such as shredded mozzarella, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives. Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and starting to brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing and serving, enjoying each bite of homemade goodness.</p>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, yeast, lukewarm water, salt, and olive oil in a mixing bowl. Knead the mixture until the dough is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza sauce. In a saucepan, simmer crushed tomatoes with minced garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and Italian herbs such as oregano and basil until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475째F (245째C) and place a pizza stone inside to heat up.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles and divide it into equal portions. Roll each portion out on a floured surface to form a thin, even circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a piece of parchment paper or a pizza peel lightly dusted with flour or cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings, such as shredded mozzarella, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated stone and bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing and serving.</li>
