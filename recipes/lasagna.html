    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        To make lasagna, start by preparing a rich meat sauce with ground beef, onions, garlic, and your favorite tomato sauce, simmering until the flavors meld together. Simultaneously, mix ricotta cheese with beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, chopped parsley, and a hint of nutmeg. Boil lasagna noodles until they are al dente, then lay them out flat to avoid sticking. In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce, followed by a layer of noodles. Over the noodles, spread a portion of the ricotta mixture, then sprinkle generously with shredded mozzarella. Repeat the layering process until all ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of noodles topped with meat sauce and a thick layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F for about 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving, ensuring each piece is perfectly layered and delicious.</p>
